# SerKit Image Assets

This directory contains image assets for the SerKit game including:

- Background images and textures
- Node icons and variations
- UI elements like buttons and panels
- Logo and branding elements

## Required Images

For the current implementation, the following image assets would be needed:

1. **Logo**: Game logo with neon cyberpunk styling
2. **Node Icons**: Visual representations for different node types
   - Start nodes (power source)
   - End nodes (destination)
   - Junction nodes (connection points)
   - Regular nodes (path points)
3. **Background Elements**: Cyberpunk-themed grid patterns and textures
4. **UI Elements**: Buttons, panels, and icons with neon styling

## Placeholder Info

For the prototype version, most visual elements are drawn programmatically using CustomPainter.
In a production version, these would be replaced with high-quality SVG or PNG assets.

When adding assets, remember to update the pubspec.yaml file to include them in the asset bundles.
